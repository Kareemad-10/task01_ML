# task01_ML
In this ML project our aim is to build a predictive regression model to predict the median house value for california districts based on multiple attributes related for each district including the longitude, latitude, population income and so on.
I tried to investigate the correlation between the different attributes and the attribute of interest which in this problem is the **median house value**.
I tried to perform strong and powerful feature engineering processes including the **feature selection**, **feature extraction** and **feature creation** to prepare our data efficiently for building a strong and powerful predictive regression model to predict the median house value for each district in california on strong basis.
